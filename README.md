# Employee Creator Backend (Spring)

{add test badges here, all projects you build from here on out will have tests, therefore you should have github workflow badges at the top of your repositories: [Github Workflow Badges](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/adding-a-workflow-status-badge)}

## Demo & Snippets

To Do:

-   Include hosted link
-   Include images of app if CLI or Client App

## Requirements / Purpose

### MVP

-   Create a web application to create, list, modify and delete employees.
-   The application should consit of a Spring RESTful API(this repo) and A React Typescript frontend (LINK EMPLOYEE CREATOR FRONTEND).
-   The Database will be created in MySQL and the Schema for which can be anything (that works).
-   e2e and unit tests must be created.
-   An API Logging strategy must be implemented
-   An Error handling strategy must be employed

### Purpose of Project

The purpose of this project is to further develop my skills utilising a Spring backend communicationg with a MySQL DB.
Especially in the areas of: - Spring backend testing (Unit and E2E) - Spring API creation/utilisation - Spring project setup - Refresh knowledge of designing simple DB Schema - Develop skills of pulling information to front end from multiple related tables - Develop skills in DB interaction from Spring (i.e. DB seeding) - Building and Deploying Spring backends

### stack

The stack utilised is a Spring and MySQL backend with a React Type Script front end.
This was chosen in order to be able to both improve my skills using Spring (and Java in general) as well as continue to further improve in my ability in React and Typescript front ends. Additionally It will improve skills in E2E testing both from frontend and backend and testing in Java which i have less experience in than I do testing in JavaScript.
